# IDP_Cooperative-localisation

This repository contains the complete work for our Intelligent Development Project (IDP) titled **"Cooperative Localization in GNSS-Denied Environments Using Machine Learning Approaches"**. The project addresses the challenge of localizing mobile agents in environments where GNSS signals are unavailable, such as during natural disasters.

## ðŸ§  Project Motivation

In GNSS-denied environments, accurately estimating position becomes difficult due to signal unavailability. To solve this, we explored **cooperative localization**, where multiple nodes share relative distance and angle information to estimate their positions. By applying **machine learning** and **constrained optimization**, we simulated a system capable of improving accuracy even in constrained conditions.
